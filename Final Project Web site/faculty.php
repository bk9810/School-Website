        <p>
        It is a great honor and pleasure to mark the welcome note on our school website. Kanadarava Middle School is one of the best schools in Sri Lanka. As a mixed Buddhist school, the school was started in 1905. Since then, the former principals worked tirelessly to nurture the school and work according to the vision of the school by utilizing the rich ethical values ​​in the Buddhist philosophy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Thousands of good people and great intellectuals who have done great service for this country have studied in this school. More than 4000 students are currently studying under the guidance of nearly 100 well-trained teachers.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The school is an excellent center for various extra-curricular activities including sports, games, drama, clubs and societies, projects and events. Our students are our strength and inspiration. Active contribution of Alumni Association and School Development Society is highly commendable.
        I invite all well-wishers to join hands with the school and strengthen us to carry forward with our motto 'Vidu Nana Manasa Pubudai' - Education enlivens the mind.
